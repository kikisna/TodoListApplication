## ToDo List Application

This Task Management System, built with Python (Flask) and MySQL, lets users register, log in, and manage tasksâ€”create, edit, complete, or delete. The application categorizes tasks into three lists: Pending Tasks, Completed Tasks and Uncompleted task. Key features include secure password hashing, session management, flash messages for feedback, and a user-friendly interface powered by Flask's HTML templates.
